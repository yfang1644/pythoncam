# {uid} = models uid or broadcaster id. This is a number which is always consistent. The models name can be changed, so this is what I find best for keeping all videos of a model in the same directory
# "{year}, {month}, {day}, {hour}, {minutes}, {seconds}" should all be easy enough to figure out what these are
# you can also change ".mp4" to another extension. ".ts" is what the stream is actual broadcast as.
# example using a madeup "hannah" who has the uid 208562: {path}/{uid}/{year}/{year}.{month}.{day}_{hour}.{minutes}.{seconds}_{model}.mp4 = "/Users/Joe/MFC/208562/2017/2017.07.26_19.34.47_hannah.mp4"

# (OPTIONAL) - leave blank if you dont want to run a post processing script on the files

# You can create a script to convert the video via ffmpeg to make it compatible for certain devices, create a contact sheet of the video
# upload the video to a cloud storage drive via rclone, or whatever else you see fit.
# set the string to be the same as you you would type into terminal to call the script manually.
# The peramaters which will be passed to the script are as follows:
# 1 = full file path (ie: /Users/Joe/MFC/208562/2017/2017.07.26_19.34.47_hannah.mp4)
# 2 = filename (ie : 2017.07.26_19.34.47_hannah.mp4)
# 3 = directory (ie : /Users/Joe/MFC/208562/hannah/2017/)
# 4 = models name (ie: hannah)
# 5 = uid (ie: 208562) (explained above)
# to call a bash script called "MoveToGoogleDrive.sh" and located in the user Joes home directory, you would use:
# postProcessingCommand = "bash /Users/Joe/home/MoveToGoogleDrive.sh"
# this script will be ran on the files "download location" prior to it being moved to its "completed location".
